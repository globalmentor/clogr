 * Provides a default Logback-based concern for logging. A logging concern is returned that recognizes the Logback SLF4J implementation.
 * @implNote As of Logback 1.3.0-alpha4 Logback no longer supports the {@link ContextSelector} mechanism for logging separation. See
 *           <a href="https://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1196">LOGBACK-1196</a> to track whether it will be reinstated in the future. This implementation still
 *           supports legacy Logback implementations that recognize configuring a default context selector in order for non-Clogr-aware libraries to use Clogr's
 *           separate configuration of concerns via Csar, although even in those cases it is not guaranteed that the Clogr context selector will be installed.
 *           In all cases however this implementation will provide access to additional Logback functionality such as setting the log level
